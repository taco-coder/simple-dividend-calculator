# simple-dividend-calculator
This is my very first time using python. I decided to make a simple dividend calculator. I know it's not much, but I figured let me run

Updated the code to include a function that grants the user the option of increasing their monthly contributions
at intervals through out the year.

User is now able to save files containing program output and overwrite specific files which can all be found in
the program created output folder.
