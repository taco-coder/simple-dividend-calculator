# simple-dividend-calculator
This is my very first time using python. I decided to make a simple dividend calculator. I know it's not much, but I figured let me run
through the docs and see what I can scrape together on a rainy day at school. (This is also my first time creating my own project on Github so the format and files may be sloppy)
